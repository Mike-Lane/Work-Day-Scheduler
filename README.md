# Work-Day-Scheduler




I have been tasked with creating a work day scheduler that meets the following criteria:
<ul>
    <li>Current day is displayed at the top of the page.</li>
    <li>time blocks displayed with standard business hours (9am - 5pm listed in mock-up).</li>
    <li>each time block is color-coded to indicate whether it is in the past(gray), present(red), or future(green).</li>
    <li>events (data) can be entered in time blocks</li>
    <li>events are saved to local storage after save button is clicked</li>
    <li>saved events persist when page is reloaded</li>
</ul>
